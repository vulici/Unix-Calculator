echo The calculator works by prompting the user for an operand, then prompting for an operator
echo Press enter once selection of the operator/operand has been made and the calculation will be displayed
echo "Operands are any digit, MR, MC, Clear (C), Off (X)"
echo "Operators are +, -, *, /, MS, M+, MC, Clear(C), Off(X)"
echo MS will store the result in memory, M+ will add the result to the value in memory
echo MC will clear the memory, MR will show the value in memory
echo "Clear(C) will clear the result but keep the memory"
echo "Off(X) will exit the program"
